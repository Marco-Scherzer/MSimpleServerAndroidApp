#### MSimpleServer is a single-developer project implemented entirely in platform-independent Java.
#### Currently it runs on Windows Desktop and Android.
#### External dependencies: BOUNCYCASTLE, GSON(ObjectMapping).
#### This early version of MSimpleServer (jar) focuses on HTTP and HTTPS handler implementations and currently supports only simple HttpServer and HttpsServer features with a focus on security through minimalism.
#### Development of MSimpleServer started in early 2025 and had reached 3 to 4 weeks of progress when it started to work for my own simple scenario purposes.
#### Features after 4 weeks:
- **Parallel accept loops for redundancy**
- **General SSL redirection** of unencrypted browser HTTP requests
- **Webpage serving**
- **Custom REST API** with own endpoint declarations

#### Since October 31, 2025, I decided to develop MSimpleServer on GitHub, continuing from this point.
#### Note: Because I use Git as an addition to my history for proof of authorship, I regularly commit things in my (anyway *to treat as private*) repositories in an unready state (nothing works).

## Runtime compatibility goal

- **Java Runtimes:** 8–25
- **Android Runtimes:** Android 10 API level 29 or newer

JRE 8 Note:
Modern SSL/TLS clients, such as current web browsers, prefere or require TLS 1.3 and updated TLS 1.2 cipher suites.
These features seem to be available in JRE 8 distributions
from version 8u261 onward (start of TLS 1.3 backport) and seem to be now complete/production ready backported
since version 8u472 (released in October 2025) in builds that follow the OpenJDK upstream.
(Testable with -Djavax.net.debug=ssl,handshake)

# Declaration to Avoid Scamming, Theft of Intellectual Property, and Deception by Fraudsters

To prevent scamming, theft of intellectual property, and the deception of persons by fraudulent
actions, I hereby make the following statement once and for all, clearly and explicitly:

**Please note:** I never grant any permissions, not in the past, not now, and not in the future.

## 1. Abuse and Phishing

To protect against abuse and phishing, please note:
There are **no other websites, email addresses, or communication channels** associated with this software except the official contact listed here.

If you encounter the code or binaries anywhere other than:

- [https://github.com/Marco-Scherzer](https://github.com/Marco-Scherzer)
- Wayback Machine (pre‑publication archiving of of this repository's content and URLs)
- https://archive.today/ and https://archive.ph/ (pre‑publication archiving of of this repository's content and URLs)

then it constitutes **abuse, a scam, and theft of law‑protected intellectual property**.

In such a case, please inform GitHub and email me.

## 2. False Claims of Involvement or Permission

Any false claim by any person to be in any way involved in my projects, or to have received any
permission from me – whether for usage, reproduction, replication, especially of APIs,
functionality, modularity, architecture, or for public display – is untrue and constitutes a *
*serious criminal offense**.

This includes in particular:

- Scamming and fraudulent deception
- Theft of intellectual property
- Always implicit defamation of the true author of a work and his business, since the truth about
  the origin of a work is reputation‑critical

I explicitly declare that I **never grant any licenses of any kind for an open source work and
especially not for its code – not in the past, not now, and not in the future.**

### Common About-Me (just to prevent wrong imaginations about people like me who write software):

I am a 43‑year‑old old‑school developer. I am an all‑rounder, not a specialist.
Not for networking, not for HTTP things or Android.
I have been developing since my very early childhood.
According to the calculation of Microsoft Copilot,
I spent more than twice as many hours developing as someone who starts at 20,
is at the same age and has a 40‑hours‑per‑week job,
because I developed most of my life Monday till Sunday for more than 12 hours a day.
Since the end of my twenties despite massive health issues and having been operated
four times in the following years in this context.
Even if I let only count the time since I was 20,
sadly this is already more than two times 23 years
(calculated as 7/5 days × 1.5 × 8 hours = 2.1 × 23 years ≈ 48.3 years) sitting in front of a computer solving problems.
Moreover, I have always been an extremely money‑poor person, intentionally living most of my life in an almost ascetic way,
enjoying only the simple things in life.
This will finally be one of my last projects because I have planned for a long time already to stop development forever,
despite helpful things like Microsoft Copilot that, since I started using it in November 2024,
for the first time in my life has saved me an amount of time.
Happily, any HTTP knowledge I needed to refresh for this project has been available on demand through Microsoft Copilot.

I recently transitioned from multiplatform development to Android-specific projects.
My current work is intended solely for internal use within my own self‑employment, which means for
myself and my projects. Until now, all of my work has been closed-source. I have always worked independently and entirely on
my own. Everything I have built has been done only on my local computer, and everything I create is formally
protected by law. Only now, in my later years, I have published something here on GitHub for the first time.
I did this in my old days as a kind of character test to the world,  
because I always had more bad than good imaginations about open source and developing openly.  
But sadly, until now it has always shown up sooner or later that I have been right from the beginning with my opinions.  
Despite that, I sometimes give certain things a chance to come to a final conclusion for myself.  
But I calculate with the worst case (that my code is just stolen or other negative things happen).
Except for what I publish here on this GitHub page (https://github.com/Marco-Scherzer),
all of my software projects remain closed-source.
